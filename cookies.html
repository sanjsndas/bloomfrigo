                <h3>1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
                <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit websites. They help websites remember information about your visit and preferences. Cookies enable core functionality like page navigation and access to secure areas. They also help website owners understand how visitors interact with their site. Some cookies are essential for technical reasons, while others enhance user experience. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify settings to decline them if preferred. Different types of cookies serve various purposes from security to analytics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p>Bloomfigo uses several types of cookies to enhance your experience on our site. Strictly necessary cookies enable core functionality and security features. Preference cookies remember your choices like language settings. Analytical cookies help us understand visitor behavior and improve our site. Marketing cookies are used to deliver relevant advertisements both on and off our site. Some cookies are session-based and expire when you close your browser, while others persist for longer periods. We periodically review our cookie usage to ensure we're respecting your privacy while providing good service.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>3. Essential Cookies</h3>
                <p>Essential cookies are critical for the basic functionality of our website and cannot be disabled. These include cookies that maintain your login session and remember items in your shopping cart. Security cookies help detect malicious activity and protect user data. Load balancer cookies distribute traffic across servers to optimize performance. Some essential cookies help ensure accessibility features work properly. If you block these cookies, certain parts of our site may not function as intended. We use the minimum necessary essential cookies to provide our services.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>4. Performance Cookies</h3>
                <p>Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, which pages are most popular, and error messages. This helps us improve how our website works by understanding what works well and what needs enhancement. These cookies don't collect information that identifies visitors personally. Data is aggregated and anonymous. We use tools like Google Analytics with anonymized IP addresses. Performance cookies help us optimize page loading times and navigation structures. You can opt-out of these cookies without significantly affecting your experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>5. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>Functionality cookies enable enhanced features by remembering your preferences and choices. These may include cookies that remember your language or region selection. They personalize your experience by greeting you with your name if you've created an account. Some functionality cookies remember your text size or contrast settings for accessibility. These cookies may also enable live chat features on our site. Information collected is anonymized and cannot track browsing activity on other websites. Disabling these cookies may result in reduced functionality but won't prevent access to our services.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>6. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>Advertising cookies track browsing habits to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. These cookies remember that you've visited our website and may share this information with advertising partners. They are used to deliver targeted advertising both on our site and through other websites. You may see ads for our services when visiting other sites due to these cookies. We limit tracking through advertising cookies and provide opt-out options. Some advertising partners belong to self-regulation programs that offer preference management tools.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>7. First-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>First-party cookies are set by our website domain and mostly support core functionality. These cookies are generally safer than third-party cookies as they can't be read by other websites. We use first-party cookies for session management, authentication, and security. Some analytics tools we use operate with first-party cookies for better data accuracy. First-party cookies typically have shorter lifespans than third-party cookies. These cookies may store your preferences for our specific site but don't track you across the web.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>8. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than bloomfigo.com, primarily by our partners. These include analytics services, social media platforms, and advertising networks. Social media cookies enable sharing capabilities and personalization across platforms. Some third-party services we embed (like maps or videos) may set their own cookies. We carefully select third-party providers with strong privacy commitments. You can manage third-party cookie preferences through our cookie consent tool or browser settings. We're working to minimize reliance on non-essential third-party cookies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>9. Cookie Duration</h3>
                <p>Session cookies expire when you close your browser and are used for temporary functions. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period or until manually deleted. Our analytical cookies typically persist for 6-12 months to track trends over time. Preference cookies may last up to 2 years to remember your settings between visits. Advertising cookies often have the longest durations, sometimes several years. We review cookie lifespans regularly to balance functionality with privacy considerations. Essential cookies generally have shorter lifespans than optional cookies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>10. Managing Cookies</h3>
                <p>You can control cookies through your browser settings, allowing you to accept, block, or delete them. Most browsers provide options to manage cookie preferences on a site-by-site basis. Mobile devices may have additional settings for controlling trackers. Blocking cookies may result in reduced functionality on our website. Our cookie consent tool lets you opt-in or out of non-essential cookie categories. Be aware that deleting cookies may clear saved preferences and require re-authentication. Browsers occasionally update their cookie management interfaces so settings may change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>11. EU Cookie Law Compliance</h3>
                <p>We comply with the EU Cookie Law (ePrivacy Directive) and GDPR requirements. Visitors from the EU see a cookie consent banner when first accessing our site. The banner clearly explains our cookie usage and provides granular opt-in options. Consent preferences are stored and respected for return visits. We maintain records of consent in compliance with accountability requirements. EU users can withdraw consent at any time through our preference center. Our systems are regularly audited to ensure continued compliance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>12. California Consumer Privacy Act</h3>
                <p>For California residents, the CCPA provides specific rights regarding personal information including cookie data. You have the right to know what personal information is collected through cookies. Our cookie policy disclosure serves as this "notice at collection" for CCPA purposes. You may opt-out of the "sale" of personal information through our cookie preference tool. We don't discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights. CCPA requests can be made through our designated webform or toll-free number.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>13. Children's Cookie Usage</h3>
                <p>We don't knowingly use tracking technologies on pages directed to children under 13. Children's accounts have additional privacy protections limiting data collection. Parental consent is required before setting non-essential cookies for child users. We minimize data collection in our children's gardening programs. Some features may be restricted for child accounts to protect privacy. Parents can review and manage their child's cookie preferences through family accounts. We comply with COPPA regulations regarding children's online privacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>14. Cookie Security</h3>
                <p>We implement security measures to protect cookies from unauthorized access. Secure cookies are transmitted only over HTTPS encrypted connections. HttpOnly cookies protect against certain types of cross-site scripting attacks. SameSite cookie attributes prevent some cross-site request forgery attempts. Sensitive cookies are encrypted and signed to prevent tampering. Our security team monitors for unusual cookie-related activity that may indicate attacks. Cookie security is part of our broader application security strategy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>15. Mobile App Cookies</h3>
                <p>Our mobile applications use similar tracking technologies as our website. Mobile platforms may use equivalent identifiers instead of traditional cookies. App tracking preferences can be managed through device settings. Some app functionality relies on local storage of preferences and settings. We follow platform guidelines for user privacy and data collection. Consistent with our web practices, mobile tracking is minimized while maintaining core functionality. App users receive onboarding screens explaining data practices and controls.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>16. Cookie Consent Management</h3>
                <p>We use a cookie consent management platform to honor user preferences. The initial banner provides clear options for accepting or declining cookies. Visitors can access preference centers to make granular choices about cookie categories. Consent choices are stored and reapplied on future visits. Our system logs consents for compliance documentation purposes. The consent interface is regularly tested for accessibility and usability. Users can change their cookie preferences at any time on our website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>17. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p>Blocking certain cookies may affect website functionality in various ways. Essential functions like logins and payments may still work, but with reduced convenience. Personalization features may reset to defaults each visit without cookies. Some content or services might become inaccessible without supporting cookies. Analytics that help us improve site performance would be less accurate. Advertising may become less relevant but more repetitive. We aim to degrade gracefully when cookies are restricted to maintain usability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>18. Cookie Policy Updates</h3>
                <p>We periodically review and update this cookie policy as needed. Significant changes will be communicated through website notices or emails where appropriate. The "last updated" date at the top indicates the current version. We maintain archives of previous cookie policies upon request. Regulatory changes or service enhancements may necessitate policy adjustments. Continued use of our site after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage periodic review of this policy to stay informed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>19. International Cookie Laws</h3>
                <p>We comply with cookie and privacy regulations in all jurisdictions where we operate. For UK and EU users, we follow the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. Canadian visitors are protected under PIPEDA requirements. Australian users benefit from Privacy Act provisions. Brazilian data protection follows LGPD guidance. We've implemented geolocation detection to apply region-specific cookie rules. Our global privacy program ensures compliance across multiple regulatory frameworks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>20. Cookie Analytics and Reporting</h3>
                <p>We analyze cookie usage data to improve our website and services. Reports help us understand feature adoption and user preferences. Aggregated metrics inform decisions about functionality to prioritize. Analytics identify opportunities to streamline the user experience. Data is anonymized and analyzed at aggregate levels, not individual users. Reporting helps us maintain an optimal balance between features and privacy. We implement data minimization in our analytics practices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>21. Social Media Cookies</h3>
                <p>Social media platforms set cookies when you interact with our social features. These may include buttons for sharing content or embedded feeds. Social cookies can track your visits across websites that use those platforms. We minimize social cookie usage to essential sharing functionality. Some social features require cookies for functionality like comment systems. You can often control social media cookies through the respective platform settings. We use privacy-protective implementation methods for social media integrations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>22. Email Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>Our emails may contain tracking pixels to measure engagement. These tiny images can show whether an email was opened and links clicked. Email tracking helps us improve communication relevance and timing. You can disable images in your email client to prevent open tracking. Link tracking can't be completely disabled but doesn't set persistent cookies. We honor unsubscribe requests promptly to respect communication preferences. Email analytics are used only for internal metrics and service improvements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>23. Third-Party Services Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use carefully selected third-party services that may set their own cookies. These include payment processors, live chat providers, and multimedia services. Each service undergoes privacy and security assessment before integration. We provide information about these cookies in our full cookie declaration. Where possible, we configure third-party services to minimize data collection. Some third parties offer opt-out mechanisms through industry programs. We continuously evaluate alternatives that offer better privacy protections.</p>

                <h3>24. Cookie Audits</h3>
                <p>We conduct regular cookie audits to maintain compliance and best practices. Audits identify all cookies and tracking technologies in use. Each cookie is categorized by purpose and necessity. The audit process helps eliminate redundant or unnecessary cookies. We document data flows and retention periods for transparency. Audit findings inform our cookie policy updates and user disclosures. Third -party services are also reviewed during these audits to ensure compliance with our standards.</p>
